EYEAM:  Endangered Animal the idea off Our App to Educate anyone to carrying for endangered species in the world. We know that wildlife existence is being threatened. If it is not taken care of, the global population and environment will become unbalanced and resulting in even worse environmental damage. The lack of education about wildlife causes humans not to understand that certain animals are endangered, especially when doing land acquisition. Even with the existence of worldwide law and regulations, humans are still a threat to wildlife populations, be it intentionally for hunting (commercial) purposes or unintentionally (destroying habitat for living areas). From these problem, we took the initiative to build this educational application for anyone. The features contained in this application, including:

- Find the endangered animal using feature in the application by species name.
- The application can detect the animal from camera features and show the information immediately.
